**How to get started?**
How to get started? This repository is organized by folders each containing its own separate template named by market or subject matter. 

Inside each template folder you will find a html file with the same name as the folder.
restaurant-promtion.html combines all three promotions by rotating them in an iframe. You can directly add this url to a schedule within rvauser.appspot.com. if you only want to use specific promotions you can remove unwanted ones from the javascript array inside this file.

The url is: http://rise-vision.github.io/content-templates/xxx/xxx.html where xxx is the name of the folder and html file name. Specific information on modifying various elements of each presentation can be found within a readme.txt inside each template folder.
