# Content Templates ![Build Status](http://devtools1.risevision.com:8080/job/Storage-Client-BranchPush/badge/icon)

## Introduction

*The Content Templates repository is organized by folders each folder contains its own separate template named by market or subject matter. Inside each template folder you will find a html file with the same name as the folder. To use within rvauser.appspot.com copy the link to this page and add to a schedule by url. Specific information on modifying various elements of each presentation can be found within a readme.txt inside each template folder.*

Content Templates works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

##Events Template##
* Animated Background -  To change the background image modify the the img tag within <div id="background"> inside events.html. The zooming and panning are created using css keyframes and transforms in the events.css style sheet.
 
* Header - CSS and media queries are utilized to change the font size and styling depending on the display resolution which can be modified inside events.css style sheet.

* Text Transition - The text transition was built with Edge Animate.  
 To modify download the text-transition folder and all of its content from github and open the text-transition-fluid.an with Edge Animate. If you do not have edge animate you can modify the text copy by changing the text-transition-fluid_edge.js file. Once your changes are made you will need to host entire contents of the text-transition folder and relink the url widget to text-transition-fluid.html.

* Logo - To change the logo image modify the the img tag within <div id="background"> inside events.html.
