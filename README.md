If you have any questions or problems please don't hesitate to join our lively and responsive community at http://community.risevision.com.

**How to get started?**
How to get started? This repository is organized by folders each containing its own separate template named by market or subject matter. 

Inside each template folder you will find a html file with the same name as the folder. 
To use within rvauser.appspot.com copy the link to this page where you have it hosted and add to a schedule by url. If you would like to view the demo for this template the url is: http://rise-vision.github.io/content-templates/xxx/xxx.html where xxx is the name of the folder and html file name. Specific information on modifying various elements of each presentation can be found within a readme.txt inside each template folder.

And if you are considering contributing to our open source projects , we have 3 good reasons why we release our  code under version 3 of the GNU General Public License:

Together we can make something far better than we could on our own.

If you want to use our code to make something that is specific to you, and that doesn’t fit with what we want to do, we don’t want to get in your way. Take our code and make just what you need.

We know that some of you nervous types worry about what happens if our company gets taken out in the zombie apocalypse. We get it, and neither one of us wants to deal with that delicate question of software escrow agreements for the “just in case we kick the bucket scenario”. No worries! We made it easy. No fuss, no cost, no lawyers! We published the software here. Have at it.

Are we missing something? Something could be better? Jump in, branch our code, make what you want, and send us a Pull Request. If it fits for both of us then of course we will accept it, maybe with a tweak or two, test it, and deploy it. If it doesn’t fit, no worries, just fork our code and create your own specialized application for your specific needs. Or, if you’re just feeling paranoid, download the code, and put it under your mattress.

Either way, welcome to our project!
